## How to Debug Disconnections

### Check Bot Logs:
Look for this detailed output:
```
üîç === DISCONNECT DETAILED DEBUG ===
Last Disconnect Object: {...}
Error Output: {...}
Error Message: "..."
üîç Detected Disconnect Reason Code: 402
üì± Message: Connection closed (402) - Network issue...
üîÑ Should Reconnect: true
```

### Common Patterns:

#### Pattern 1: Frequent 408 (Connection Lost)
- **Cause:** Unstable internet or Render sleeping
- **Fix:** Check Render logs, ensure uptime monitoring is active

#### Pattern 2: 440 (Connection Replaced)
- **Cause:** Multiple devices/sessions connected
- **Fix:** Go to WhatsApp ‚Üí Linked Devices, remove duplicates

#### Pattern 3: 401 (Logged Out) after bot restart
- **Cause:** Session wasn't backed up to Supabase
- **Fix:** Make sure Supabase storage bucket exists and is configured

#### Pattern 4: Frequent 402 (Connection Closed)
- **Cause:** Rate limiting or too aggressive connection attempts
- **Fix:** Increase reconnect delay in anti-ban config

## Auto-Reconnect Behavior

The bot will automatically reconnect for these reasons:
- ‚úÖ Connection closed (402)
- ‚úÖ Connection lost (408)
- ‚úÖ Timed out (504)
- ‚úÖ Restart required
- ‚úÖ Network issues

The bot will NOT auto-reconnect for:
- ‚ùå Logged out (401) - needs QR code
- ‚ùå Bad session (500) - session corrupted

---

## Session Persistence

**How it works:**
1. Session files saved to local `./sessions` folder
2. Session backed up to Supabase Storage on connection
3. On restart: Bot tries to restore from Supabase
4. If found: No QR code needed ‚úÖ
5. If not found: Shows QR code ‚ö†Ô∏è

**To ensure session persists:**
- ‚úÖ Supabase URL configured
- ‚úÖ SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY set in .env
- ‚úÖ `whatsapp-sessions` bucket created in Supabase dashboard

## Quick Fixes

### If bot keeps disconnecting:
1. Check the disconnect reason code in logs
2. Match it to the solutions above
3. Apply the recommended fix
4. Restart bot if needed

### If you see QR code after restart:
1. Check if session exists in Supabase Storage
2. Verify `whatsapp-sessions` bucket is accessible
3. Check SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY is set correctly
4. If missing, re-scan QR code (should work better now)

### If "Connection Replaced" keeps happening:
1. Go to WhatsApp on your phone
2. Settings ‚Üí Linked Devices
3. Remove all bot sessions
4. Wait for bot to reconnect with fresh session

## Monitoring Setup

**To prevent disconnections on Render:**

1. **Set up UptimeRobot** (free):
   - URL: `https://your-app.onrender.com/health`
   - Interval: 5 minutes
   - This keeps your Render service awake

2. **Check Service Health:**
   ```bash
   curl https://your-app.onrender.com/health
   ```

3. **Monitor Session Backups:**
   - Check Supabase Storage ‚Üí `whatsapp-sessions` bucket
   - Verify session files are being uploaded
