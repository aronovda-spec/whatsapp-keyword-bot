# File Processing Implementation Proposal

## Current State
- ❌ PDFs: Not processed
- ❌ Excel/Word: Not processed
- ❌ Images: Not processed  
- ❌ Documents: Ignored
- ✅ Text messages: Fully supported

## Proposed Implementation

### Option 1: Basic Attachment Detection (Easiest)
**Detect when messages have attachments and notify with metadata**

```javascript
// What we'd add:
- Detect file types (PDF, Excel, Image, etc.)
- Extract file metadata (name, size, type)
- Include in notifications
- Optional: Check for keywords in file names
```

**Pros:** Quick to implement, low complexity  
**Cons:** Can't check file contents

### Option 2: Text Extraction from Files (Advanced)
**Extract text from PDFs, Excel, Word, Images (OCR)**

```javascript
// What we'd need:
- pdf-parse for PDF text extraction
- xlsx for Excel parsing
- mammoth for Word documents
- tesseract or OCR library for images
- File download handling from WhatsApp
```

**Pros:** Can detect keywords inside files  
**Cons:** More complex, requires dependencies, slower processing

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Recommended)
**Detect all attachments + extract text where possible**

```javascript
// Implementation:
1. Detect all message types (text, image, document, audio)
2. Extract text from captions/names
3. For PDFs/Word: Download & extract text (optional)
4. For Images: Use OCR if keyword found in caption (optional)
5. Send comprehensive notifications
```

## Recommended Libraries

### For PDF Processing
```bash
npm install pdf-parse
```

### For Excel Processing
```bash
npm install xlsx
```

### For Image OCR
```bash
npm install tesseract.js
```

### For Word Documents
```bash
npm install mammoth
```

## Implementation Complexity

| Feature | Effort | Impact |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Detect attachments | Low | Medium |
| Extract file metadata | Low | Medium |
| PDF text extraction | Medium | High |
| Excel text extraction | Medium | High |
| Image OCR | High | High |
| Word processing | Medium | Medium |

## Next Steps

Would you like me to:
1. ✅ Implement basic attachment detection (show file names in notifications)
2. ✅ Implement PDF/text extraction (extract keywords from documents)
3. ✅ Implement image OCR (extract text from images)
4. ✅ Implement all of the above
